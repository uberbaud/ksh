^Btypeset^b [[^B+-lprtUux^b] [^B-L^b[^U^Bn^b^u]] [^B-R^b[^U^Bn^b^u]] [^B-Z^b[^U^Bn^b^u]] [^B-i^b[^U^Bn^b^u]] | ^B-f^b [^B-tux^b]] [^U^Bname^b^u
        [=^U^Bvalue^b^u] ^U^B...^b^u]
        Display or set parameter attributes.  With no ^U^Bname^b^u arguments,
        parameter attributes are displayed; if no options are used, the
        current attributes of all parameters are printed as ^Btypeset^b
        commands; if an option is given (or ‘-’ with no option letter),
        all parameters and their values with the specified attributes are
        printed; if options are introduced with ‘+’, parameter values are
        not printed.

        If ^U^Bname^b^u arguments are given, the attributes of the named
        parameters are set (^B-^b) or cleared (^B+^b).  Values for parameters may
        optionally be specified.  If ^Btypeset^b is used inside a function,
        any newly created parameters are local to the function.

        When ^B-f^b is used, ^Btypeset^b operates on the attributes of functions.
        As with parameters, if no ^U^Bname^b^u arguments are given, functions are
        listed with their values (i.e. definitions) unless options are
        introduced with ‘+’, in which case only the function names are
        reported.

        ^B-f^b      Function mode.  Display or set functions and their
                attributes, instead of parameters.

        ^B-i^b[^U^Bn^b^u]   Integer attribute.  ^U^Bn^b^u specifies the base to use when
                displaying the integer (if not specified, the base given
                in the first assignment is used).  Parameters with this
                attribute may be assigned values containing arithmetic
                expressions.

        ^B-L^b[^U^Bn^b^u]   Left justify attribute.  ^U^Bn^b^u specifies the field width.  If
                ^U^Bn^b^u is not specified, the current width of a parameter (or
                the width of its first assigned value) is used.  Leading
                whitespace (and zeros, if used with the ^B-Z^b option) is
                stripped.  If necessary, values are either truncated or
                space padded to fit the field width.

        ^B-l^b      Lower case attribute.  All upper case characters in
                values are converted to lower case.  (In the original
                Korn shell, this parameter meant “long integer” when used
                with the ^B-i^b option.)

        ^B-p^b      Print complete ^Btypeset^b commands that can be used to re-
                create the attributes (but not the values) of parameters.
                This is the default action (option exists for ksh93
                compatibility).

        ^B-R^b[^U^Bn^b^u]   Right justify attribute.  ^U^Bn^b^u specifies the field width.
                If ^U^Bn^b^u is not specified, the current width of a parameter
                (or the width of its first assigned value) is used.
                Trailing whitespace is stripped.  If necessary, values
                are either stripped of leading characters or space padded
                to make them fit the field width.

        ^B-r^b      Read-only attribute.  Parameters with this attribute may
                not be assigned to or unset.  Once this attribute is set,
                it cannot be turned off.

        ^B-t^b      Tag attribute.  Has no meaning to the shell; provided for
                application use.

                For functions, ^B-t^b is the trace attribute.  When functions
                with the trace attribute are executed, the ^Bxtrace^b (^B-x^b)
                shell option is temporarily turned on.

        ^B-U^b      Unsigned integer attribute.  Integers are printed as
                unsigned values (only useful when combined with the ^B-i^b
                option).  This option is not in the original Korn shell.

        ^B-u^b      Upper case attribute.  All lower case characters in
                values are converted to upper case.  (In the original
                Korn shell, this parameter meant “unsigned integer” when
                used with the ^B-i^b option, which meant upper case letters
                would never be used for bases greater than 10.  See the
                ^B-U^b option.)

                For functions, ^B-u^b is the undefined attribute.  See
                ^U^BFunctions^b^u above for the implications of this.

        ^B-x^b      Export attribute.  Parameters (or functions) are placed
                in the environment of any executed commands.  Exported
                functions are not yet implemented.

        ^B-Z^b[^U^Bn^b^u]   Zero fill attribute.  If not combined with ^B-L^b, this is
                the same as ^B-R^b, except zero padding is used instead of
                space padding.
