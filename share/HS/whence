^Bwhence^b [^B-pv^b] [^U^Bname^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        For each ^U^Bname^b^u, the type of command is listed (reserved word,
        built-in, alias, function, tracked alias, or executable).  If the
        ^B-p^b option is used, a path search is performed even if ^U^Bname^b^u is a
        reserved word, alias, etc.  Without the ^B-v^b option, ^Bwhence^b is
        similar to ^Bcommand^b ^B-v^b except that ^Bwhence^b won't print aliases as
        alias commands.  With the ^B-v^b option, ^Bwhence^b is the same as
        ^Bcommand^b ^B-V^b.  Note that for ^Bwhence^b, the ^B-p^b option does not affect
        the search path used, as it does for ^Bcommand^b.  If the type of one
        or more of the names could not be determined, the exit status is
        non-zero.
