^Bbind^b [^B-l^b]
        The current bindings are listed.  If the ^B-l^b flag is given, ^Bbind^b
        instead lists the names of the functions to which keys may be
        bound.  See ^U^BEmacs^b^u ^U^Bediting^b^u ^U^Bmode^b^u for more information.

^Bbind^b [^B-m^b] ^U^Bstring^b^u=[^U^Bsubstitute^b^u] ^U^B...^b^u
^Bbind^b ^U^Bstring^b^u=[^U^Bediting-command^b^u] ^U^B...^b^u
        The specified editing command is bound to the given ^U^Bstring^b^u.
        Future input of the ^U^Bstring^b^u will cause the editing command to be
        immediately invoked.  If the ^B-m^b flag is given, the specified
        input ^U^Bstring^b^u will afterwards be immediately replaced by the given
        ^U^Bsubstitute^b^u string, which may contain editing commands.  Control
        characters may be written using caret notation.  For example, ^^X
        represents Control-X.

        If a certain character occurs as the first character of any bound
        multi-character ^U^Bstring^b^u sequence, that character becomes a command
        prefix character.  Any character sequence that starts with a
        command prefix character but that is not bound to a command or
        substitute is implicitly considered as bound to the ‘error’
        command.  By default, two command prefix characters exist: Escape
        (^^[) and Control-X (^X).

        The following default bindings show how the arrow keys on an ANSI
        terminal or xterm are bound (of course some escape sequences
        won't work out quite this nicely):

              bind '^^[[A'=up-history
              bind '^^[[B'=down-history
              bind '^^[[C'=forward-char
              bind '^^[[D'=backward-char
