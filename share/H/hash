^Bhash^b [^B-r^b] [^U^Bname^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        Without arguments, any hashed executable command pathnames are
        listed.  The ^B-r^b option causes all hashed commands to be removed
        from the hash table.  Each ^U^Bname^b^u is searched as if it were a
        command name and added to the hash table if it is an executable
        command.
