    ^T\e[2K^t    Clear the entire line

    ^T\e[^t^Sn^s^TS^t    Scroll screen up by ^Sn^s lines
    ^T\e[^t^Sn^s^TT^t    Scroll screen down by ^Sn^s lines

    ^T\e[6n^t    Report cursor position as ^B\e[^b^Sr^s^B;^b^Sc^s^BR^b

    ^T\e[s^t     Save the cursor position

    ^BColors^b

    ^T\e[38;2;^t^Sr^s^T;^t^Sb^s^T;^t^Sg^s^Tm^t     Use ^ITrue Color^i. ^Srgb^s are in decimal.
    ^T\e[38;5;^t^Sn^s^Tm^t         Use ^I256 color^i: ^Sn^s is an index into the color palette.
