^Bsuspend^b
        Stops the shell as if it had received the suspend character from
        the terminal.  It is not possible to suspend a login shell unless
        the parent process is a member of the same terminal session but
        is a member of a different process group.  As a general rule, if
        the shell was started by another shell or via su(1), it can be
        suspended.
