^Bread^b [^B-prsu^b[^U^Bn^b^u]] [^U^Bparameter^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        Reads a line of input from the standard input, separates the line
        into fields using the IFS parameter (see ^U^BSubstitution^b^u above), and
        assigns each field to the specified parameters.  If there are
        more parameters than fields, the extra parameters are set to
        NULL, or alternatively, if there are more fields than parameters,
        the last parameter is assigned the remaining fields (inclusive of
        any separating spaces).  If no parameters are specified, the
        REPLY parameter is used.  If the input line ends in a backslash
        and the ^B-r^b option was not used, the backslash and the newline are
        stripped and more input is read.  If no input is read, ^Bread^b exits
        with a non-zero status.

        The first parameter may have a question mark and a string
        appended to it, in which case the string is used as a prompt
        (printed to standard error before any input is read) if the input
        is a tty(4) (e.g. ^Bread^b ^Bnfoo?'number^b ^Bof^b ^Bfoos:^b ^B'^b).

        The ^B-u^b^U^Bn^b^u and ^B-p^b options cause input to be read from file
        descriptor ^U^Bn^b^u (^U^Bn^b^u defaults to 0 if omitted) or the current co-
        process (see ^U^BCo-processes^b^u above for comments on this),
        respectively.  If the ^B-s^b option is used, input is saved to the
        history file.
