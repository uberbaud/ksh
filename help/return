^Breturn^b [^U^Bstatus^b^u]
        Returns from a function or ^B.^b script, with exit status ^U^Bstatus^b^u.  If
        no ^U^Bstatus^b^u is given, the exit status of the last executed command
        is used.  If used outside of a function or ^B.^b script, it has the
        same effect as ^Bexit^b.  Note that ^Bksh^b treats both profile and ENV
        files as ^B.^b scripts, while the original Korn shell only treats
        profiles as ^B.^b scripts.
