#: FUNCTION ^Ucmd^u ^Ufilename^u ^U...^u
#:   Iterates over all applicapable ^IVMS^ies and performs ^Ucmd^u.
#:
#:   If ^VFOREACH_VMS^v is set to a valid command, that will be 
#:   performed at the end of each iteration.
#:
#:   Local variables available to the function in ^VFOREACH_VMS^v are: 
#:   ^Vcmd^v, ^Vfilename^v, ^Vvms^v, ^VvmsCmd^v, and ^Vfn^v. Where 
#:   ^VvmsCmd^v is "^O$^o^Vvms^v-^O$^o^Vcmd^v", and ^Vfn^v is either 
#:   ^O$^o^VFOREACH_VMS^v or the shell command ^T:^t.
