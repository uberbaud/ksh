# SHA1 is the fastest on my system (amd64) of any of the cksum
# algorithms, more than twice as fast as sha224 or sha256, and nearly
# twice as fast as the 64 bit SHAs (384, 512/256, 512). But it's even
# faster than md5, or the traditional cksum algorithm. It is also faster
# than b3sum, which is faster than the others and a better choice for
# crypt-hashes which will be used as file system names, or when security
# is an issue.
