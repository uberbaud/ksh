^Bumask^b [^B-S^b] [^U^Bmask^b^u]
        Display or set the file permission creation mask, or umask (see
        umask(2)).  If the ^B-S^b option is used, the mask displayed or set
        is symbolic; otherwise, it is an octal number.

        Symbolic masks are like those used by chmod(1).  When used, they
        describe what permissions may be made available (as opposed to
        octal masks in which a set bit means the corresponding bit is to
        be cleared).  For example, “ug=rwx,o=” sets the mask so files
        will not be readable, writable, or executable by “others”, and is
        equivalent (on most systems) to the octal mask “007”.
