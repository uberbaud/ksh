#: FUNCTION ^Ucmd^u ^Uarg1^u ^S…^s ^UargN^u
#:   Wrapper around ^Tdoas^t with the added feature of
#:   highlighting in scripts that that doas is being run
#:   AND what command doas will used to run.
#:
#:   Additionally provides a single point to update if ^Tdoas^t is replaced,
#:   for instance with ^Tsudo^t.
