#: FUNCTION ^Ufile^u
#:   Wrap ^Tcksum -qa sha1b^t for memories sake.

# FOR hashing a SINGLE FILE (1 file) at at time:
# SHA1 is the fastest on my system (amd64) of any of the cksum 
# algorithms including md5 or crc32. It is also faster than b3sum, which 
# is faster than the others and a better choice for crypt-hashes which 
# will be used as file system names, or when security is an issue.
#
# BLAKE3 (b3sum) is much faster for many files at once, but the 
# executable itself takes much longer to load, process it's parameters, 
# etc which obliterates any speed advantage of the algorithm itself.
