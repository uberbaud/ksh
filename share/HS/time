^Btime^b [^B-p^b] [^U^Bpipeline^b^u]
        If a ^U^Bpipeline^b^u is given, the times used to execute the pipeline
        are reported.  If no pipeline is given, then the user and system
        time used by the shell itself, and all the commands it has run
        since it was started, are reported.  The times reported are the
        real time (elapsed time from start to finish), the user CPU time
        (time spent running in user mode), and the system CPU time (time
        spent running in kernel mode).  Times are reported to standard
        error; the format of the output is:

              0m0.00s real     0m0.00s user     0m0.00s system

        If the ^B-p^b option is given the output is slightly longer:

              real     0.00
              user     0.00
              sys      0.00

        It is an error to specify the ^B-p^b option unless ^U^Bpipeline^b^u is a
        simple command.

        Simple redirections of standard error do not affect the output of
        the ^Btime^b command:

              $ time sleep 1 2> afile
              $ { time sleep 1; } 2> afile

        Times for the first command do not go to “afile”, but those of
        the second command do.
