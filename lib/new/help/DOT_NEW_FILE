    A ^B.new^b file sets actions for ^Tnew^t in that directory.  The file may
    contain empty lines, comment lines, and declarations.  Comment lines
    start with an octothorpe (^#) or semi-colon (^;).  Declarations may be
    ^Bdefaults^b or a ^Bredirect^b.

    ^BDEFAULTS FILE^b

    Each declaration has the format:
        ^Ufiletype^u^T:^t^[^Umod1^u^] ^G# The colon ^Bis^b mandatory.^g

    The first declaration sets the default ^Ufiletype^u if neither ^T-t^t nor an
    extension is used. Additional declarations set a default ^Umod^u for the
    given filetype.

    ^BREDIRECT^b

    A redirect file causes ^Tnew^t to create the file in an ^Ualternate path^u,
    and then create a soft link (symlink) from that file in this
    directory. A redirect ^T.new^t file contains exactly one (1) declaration
    which begins with a ^T>^t (closed angle bracket or greater-than sign),
    optionally followed by space or tab characters, and then the alternate
    path, which may include shell style variables. Everything after the
    ^T>^t and any white space is the alternate path including any octothorpe
    and white space, so comments must be on other lines.

    The redirect declaration has the format:
        ^T>^t ^O$^o^VKDOTDIR^v^T/share/BS^t

    The alternate path may be absolute or relative and the symlink will be
    created with exactly that path.
