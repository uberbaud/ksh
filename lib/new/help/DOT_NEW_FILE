    contain empty lines, comment lines, and declarations.  Comment lines
    start with an octothorpe (^#) or semi-colon (^;).  Declarations may be
    ^Bdefaults^b or a ^Bredirect^b.

    ^BDEFAULTS FILE^b

    Each declaration has the format:
        ^Ufiletype^u^T:^t^[^Umod1^u^] ^G# The colon ^Bis^b mandatory.^g

    The first declaration sets the default ^Ufiletype^u if neither ^T-t^t nor
    an extension is used. Additional declarations set a default ^Umod^u for
    the given filetype.

    ^BREDIRECT^b

    ^Ualternate path^u, and then create a soft link from that file in this
