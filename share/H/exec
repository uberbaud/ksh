^Bexec^b [^U^Bcommand^b^u [^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]]
        The command is executed without forking, replacing the shell
        process.

        If no command is given except for I/O redirection, the I/O
        redirection is permanent and the shell is not replaced.  Any file
        descriptors greater than 2 which are opened or dup(2)'d in this
        way are not made available to other executed commands (i.e.
        commands that are not built-in to the shell).  Note that the
        Bourne shell differs here; it does pass these file descriptors
        on.
