^Becho^b [^B-Een^b] [^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        Prints its arguments (separated by spaces) followed by a newline,
        to the standard output.  The newline is suppressed if any of the
        arguments contain the backslash sequence ‘\c’.  See the ^Bprint^b
        command below for a list of other backslash sequences that are
        recognized.

        The options are provided for compatibility with BSD shell
        scripts.  The ^B-n^b option suppresses the trailing newline, ^B-e^b
        enables backslash interpretation (a no-op, since this is normally
        done), and ^B-E^b suppresses backslash interpretation.  If the ^Bposix^b
        option is set, only the first argument is treated as an option,
        and only if it is exactly “-n”.
