^BCHANGES BETWEEN C STANDARDS^b

^BK&R -> C89^b

    ^BFunction Prototypes^b
    ^Bvoid pointers^b


^BC95 Addendum^b

    Added ^Bdigraphs^b and ^Bwide character^b support.
    Added standard macros ^T__STDC_VERSION__^t and others like ^Tand^t.

^BC89 -> C99^b

    ^BLine comments^b (^T//^t)
    ^BIdentifier length^b expanded from 31 to 63, and external identifiers 
        length expanded from 6 to 31 and become case sensitive.
    New ^Bkeywords^b: ^Tinline^t, ^Trestrict^t, ^T_Bool^t, ^T_Complex^t, 
        ^T_Imaginary^t, plus ^Tlong long^t.
    Require ^Btruncating toward zero (0)^b of integer division (^T/^t) and 
        modulo (^T%^t) operators. In C89 this is undefined.
    ^BVariable declarations^b may be intermingled with code and are allowed 
        in the first statement of a ^Ifor^i loop.
    New ^Barray^b features: ^Idesignated initializers^i, 
        ^Icompoundr literals^i, and ^Ivariable length^i and 
        ^Iflexible arrays^i (unsized) at the end of structures.
    ^BVariadic macros^b and ^B__func__^b macro.
    ^BConversion specification^b is changed for ^Tprintf^t^(^) and 
        ^Tscanf^t^(^).
    ^BNew includes^b: ^Tstdbool.h^t, ^Tstdint.h^t, ^Tinttypes.h^t, 
        ^Tcomplex.h^t, ^Ttgmath.h^t, and ^Tfenv.h^t.
    Allows ^BUnicode Identifiers^b. Example ^Tint ∆ = 1;^t. Some compilers 
        may require an escaped form which would be written as
            ^Tint \u0394 = 1;^t.
    Removed implicit function definitions and implicit ^Tint^t.
    Trailing comma allowed in enum declarations.

^BC99 -> C11^b

    ^BMemory Alignment^b: ^T_Alignas^t, ^T_Alignof^t, and
        ^Taligned_alloc^t, ^<^Tstdalign.h^t^>
    ^BType-generic macros^b
    New ^Bkeywords^b: ^T_Generic^t, ^T_Noreturn^t
    ^BThreads^b support.
    ^<^Tstdatomic.h^t^> uninterruptible objects access
    ^BAnonymous^b structs and unions
    ^BUnicode^b support through <uchar.h>
    ^BSafer^b ^Tstrcat_s^t^^(^), ^Tstrncpy_s^t^(^), ^Tgets_s^t^(^), (removed 
        ^Tgets^t^(^)), and ^Tfopen_s^t^(^).
    ^Tfopen^t^(^) has exclusive create-and-open mode ("..x")
    ^BCompound Literals^b Like anonymous structures in ^Bzig^b but also an 
        initializer like C strings but with things other than ^Tchar^t, so
            ^Tfloat *f = (float []){ 1.07, 1e3, 3.141592654 }^t
        where f is a readonly value of three (3) floats.

^BC11 -> C17^b

    ^BC17^b revises ^BC11^b to resolve defects but neither introduces nor 
        deprecates language features.

^BC17 -> C23^b

    ^BC23^b adds
    ^T<stdckdint.h>^t with macros ^Tckd_add^t to provide signed integer with 
    infinite range arithmetic simulation;

    ^T<stdbit.h>^t with bit handling things.

    ^Tmemset_explicit^t to avoid optimizing out memory clearing code;

    ^Ttrue^t, ^Tfalse^t, and ^Tnullptr^t are language keywords,

    ^Ttypeof^t feature,

    ^T#embed^t for arbitrary binary data,

    ^T={}^t syntax for zeroed local structs and variable-length arrays,

    ^T0b^t prefix for binary representation of numbers,

    ^Tconstexpr^t compile time constant so that ^Tint a[^t^Vx^v^T]^t can be an array
    instead of a ^IVLA^i if ^Vx^v is declared as ^Tconstexpr^t. Can also be
    used on ^BCompound Literals^b.
        ^Ttypedef struct crime { int criming; } crime;^t
        ^Tconst crime crimes = (constexpr crime){ 11 };^t
        ^Tint main (void) { return crimes.criming; }^t

    ^BOptional comma variadic args comma^b in macros
        ^T#define x(arg1, …) fn(arg1, __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__)^t

    ^BVariadic function with no required arg1^b
        ^Tfn(...)^t

    ^Btyped enumerations^b
        ^Tenum e : uint8_t { x, y, z };^t

    ^WWARNING^w
    ^BC23^b redeclares ^Trealloc(^t^Up^u^T,0)^t from ^Ifrees and returns 
    ^BNULL^b^i to ^Iundefined behavior^i.
