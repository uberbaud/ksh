^Bset^b [^B+-abCefhkmnpsuvXx^b] [^B+-o^b ^U^Boption^b^u] [^B+-A^b ^U^Bname^b^u] [^B--^b] [^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        The ^Bset^b command can be used to set (^B-^b) or clear (^B+^b) shell
        options, set the positional parameters, or set an array
        parameter.  Options can be changed using the ^B+-o^b ^U^Boption^b^u syntax,
        where ^U^Boption^b^u is the long name of an option, or using the ^B+-^b^U^Bletter^b^u
        syntax, where ^U^Bletter^b^u is the option's single letter name (not all
        options have a single letter name).  The following table lists
        both option letters (if they exist) and long names along with a
        description of what the option does:

        ^B-A^b ^U^Bname^b^u          Sets the elements of the array parameter ^U^Bname^b^u to
                         ^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u If ^B-A^b is used, the array is reset (i.e.
                         emptied) first; if ^B+A^b is used, the first N
                         elements are set (where N is the number of
                         arguments); the rest are left untouched.

        ^B-a^b | ^Ballexport^b   All new parameters are created with the export
                         attribute.

        ^B-b^b | ^Bnotify^b      Print job notification messages asynchronously,
                         instead of just before the prompt.  Only used if
                         job control is enabled (^B-m^b).

        ^B-C^b | ^Bnoclobber^b   Prevent ^B>^b redirection from overwriting existing
                         files.  Instead, ^B>|^b must be used to force an
                         overwrite.

        ^B-e^b | ^Berrexit^b     Exit (after executing the ERR trap) as soon as
                         an error occurs or a command fails (i.e. exits
                         with a non-zero status).  This does not apply to
                         commands whose exit status is explicitly tested
                         by a shell construct such as ^Bif^b, ^Buntil^b, ^Bwhile^b,
                         or ^B!^b statements.  For ^B&&^b or ^B||^b, only the status
                         of the last command is tested.

        ^B-f^b | ^Bnoglob^b      Do not expand file name patterns.

        ^B-h^b | ^Btrackall^b    Create tracked aliases for all executed commands
                         (see ^U^BAliases^b^u above).  Enabled by default for
                         non-interactive shells.

        ^B-k^b | ^Bkeyword^b     Parameter assignments are recognized anywhere in
                         a command.

        ^B-m^b | ^Bmonitor^b     Enable job control (default for interactive
                         shells).

        ^B-n^b | ^Bnoexec^b      Do not execute any commands.  Useful for
                         checking the syntax of scripts (ignored if
                         interactive).

        ^B-p^b | ^Bprivileged^b  The shell is a privileged shell.  It is set
                         automatically if, when the shell starts, the
                         real UID or GID does not match the effective UID
                         (EUID) or GID (EGID), respectively.  See above
                         for a description of what this means.

        ^B-s^b | ^Bstdin^b       If used when the shell is invoked, commands are
                         read from standard input.  Set automatically if
                         the shell is invoked with no arguments.

                         When ^B-s^b is used with the ^Bset^b command it causes
                         the specified arguments to be sorted before
                         assigning them to the positional parameters (or
                         to array ^U^Bname^b^u, if ^B-A^b is used).

        ^B-u^b | ^Bnounset^b     Referencing of an unset parameter is treated as
                         an error, unless one of the ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘=’
                         modifiers is used.

        ^B-v^b | ^Bverbose^b     Write shell input to standard error as it is
                         read.

        ^B-X^b | ^Bmarkdirs^b    Mark directories with a trailing ‘/’ during file
                         name generation.

        ^B-x^b | ^Bxtrace^b      Print commands and parameter assignments when
                         they are executed, preceded by the value of PS4.

        ^Bbgnice^b           Background jobs are run with lower priority.

        ^Bbraceexpand^b      Enable brace expansion (a.k.a. alternation).

        ^Bcsh-history^b      Enables a subset of csh(1)-style history editing
                         using the ‘!’ character.

        ^Bemacs^b            Enable BRL emacs-like command-line editing
                         (interactive shells only); see ^U^BEmacs^b^u ^U^Bediting^b^u
                         ^U^Bmode^b^u.

        ^Bemacs-usemeta^b    In emacs command-line editing, use the 8th bit
                         as meta (^^[) prefix.  This is the default.

        ^Bgmacs^b            Enable gmacs-like command-line editing
                         (interactive shells only).  Currently identical
                         to emacs editing except that transpose (^^T) acts
                         slightly differently.

        ^Bignoreeof^b        The shell will not (easily) exit when end-of-
                         file is read; ^Bexit^b must be used.  To avoid
                         infinite loops, the shell will exit if EOF is
                         read 13 times in a row.

        ^Binteractive^b      The shell is an interactive shell.  This option
                         can only be used when the shell is invoked.  See
                         above for a description of what this means.

        ^Blogin^b            The shell is a login shell.  This option can
                         only be used when the shell is invoked.  See
                         above for a description of what this means.

        ^Bnohup^b            Do not kill running jobs with a SIGHUP signal
                         when a login shell exits.  Currently set by
                         default; this is different from the original
                         Korn shell (which doesn't have this option, but
                         does send the SIGHUP signal).

        ^Bnolog^b            No effect.  In the original Korn shell, this
                         prevents function definitions from being stored
                         in the history file.

        ^Bphysical^b         Causes the ^Bcd^b and ^Bpwd^b commands to use “physical”
                         (i.e. the filesystem's) ‘..’ directories instead
                         of “logical” directories (i.e. the shell handles
                         ‘..’, which allows the user to be oblivious of
                         symbolic links to directories).  Clear by
                         default.  Note that setting this option does not
                         affect the current value of the PWD parameter;
                         only the ^Bcd^b command changes PWD.  See the ^Bcd^b and
                         ^Bpwd^b commands above for more details.

        ^Bposix^b            Enable POSIX mode.  See ^U^BPOSIX^b^u ^U^Bmode^b^u above.

        ^Brestricted^b       The shell is a restricted shell.  This option
                         can only be used when the shell is invoked.  See
                         above for a description of what this means.

        ^Bsh^b               Enable strict Bourne shell mode (see ^U^BStrict^b^u
                         ^U^BBourne^b^u ^U^Bshell^b^u ^U^Bmode^b^u above).

        ^Bvi^b               Enable vi(1)-like command-line editing
                         (interactive shells only).

        ^Bvi-esccomplete^b   In vi command-line editing, do command and file
                         name completion when escape (^^[) is entered in
                         command mode.

        ^Bvi-show8^b         Prefix characters with the eighth bit set with
                         ‘M-’.  If this option is not set, characters in
                         the range 128-160 are printed as is, which may
                         cause problems.

        ^Bvi-tabcomplete^b   In vi command-line editing, do command and file
                         name completion when tab (^^I) is entered in
                         insert mode.  This is the default.

        ^Bviraw^b            No effect.  In the original Korn shell, unless
                         ^Bviraw^b was set, the vi command-line mode would
                         let the tty(4) driver do the work until ESC (^^[)
                         was entered.  ^Bksh^b is always in viraw mode.

        These options can also be used upon invocation of the shell.  The
        current set of options (with single letter names) can be found in
        the parameter ‘$-’.  ^Bset^b ^B-o^b with no option name will list all the
        options and whether each is on or off; ^Bset^b ^B+o^b will print the
        current shell options in a form that can be reinput to the shell
        to achieve the same option settings.

        Remaining arguments, if any, are positional parameters and are
        assigned, in order, to the positional parameters (i.e. $1, $2,
        etc.).  If options end with ‘--’ and there are no remaining
        arguments, all positional parameters are cleared.  If no options
        or arguments are given, the values of all names are printed.  For
        unknown historical reasons, a lone ‘-’ option is treated
        specially - it clears both the ^B-x^b and ^B-v^b options.
