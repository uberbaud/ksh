^Btest^b ^U^Bexpression^b^u
^B[^b ^U^Bexpression^b^u ^B]^b
        ^Btest^b evaluates the ^U^Bexpression^b^u and returns zero status if true, 1
        if false, or greater than 1 if there was an error.  It is
        normally used as the condition command of ^Bif^b and ^Bwhile^b
        statements.  Symbolic links are followed for all ^U^Bfile^b^u expressions
        except ^B-h^b and ^B-L^b.

        The following basic expressions are available:

        ^B-G^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u's group is the shell's effective group
                           ID.

        ^B-g^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u's mode has the setgid bit set.

        ^B-h^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u is a symbolic link.

        ^B-k^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u's mode has the sticky(8) bit set.

        ^B-L^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u is a symbolic link.

        ^B-O^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u's owner is the shell's effective user ID.

        ^B-o^b ^U^Boption^b^u          Shell ^U^Boption^b^u is set (see the ^Bset^b command above
                           for a list of options).  As a non-standard
                           extension, if the option starts with a ‘!’,
                           the test is negated; the test always fails if
                           ^U^Boption^b^u doesn't exist (so [ -o foo -o -o !foo ]
                           returns true if and only if option ^U^Bfoo^b^u
                           exists).

        ^B-p^b ^U^Bfile^b^u            ^U^Bfile^b^u is a named pipe.

        ^B-t^b [^U^Bfd^b^u]            File descriptor ^U^Bfd^b^u is a tty(4) device.  If the
                           ^Bposix^b option is not set, ^U^Bfd^b^u may be left out,
                           in which case it is taken to be 1 (the
                           behaviour differs due to the special POSIX
                           rules described above).

                           ^U^Bfile2^b^u does not.

        ^U^Bfile1^b^u ^B-ot^b ^U^Bfile2^b^u    ^U^Bfile1^b^u is older than ^U^Bfile2^b^u or ^U^Bfile2^b^u exists and
                           ^U^Bfile1^b^u does not.

        ^U^Bfile1^b^u ^B-ef^b ^U^Bfile2^b^u    ^U^Bfile1^b^u is the same file as ^U^Bfile2^b^u.

        ^U^Bstring^b^u             ^U^Bstring^b^u has non-zero length.

        ^B-n^b ^U^Bstring^b^u          ^U^Bstring^b^u is not empty.

        ^U^Bnumber^b^u ^B-gt^b ^U^Bnumber^b^u  Numbers compare greater than.

        ^U^Bnumber^b^u ^B-le^b ^U^Bnumber^b^u  Numbers compare less than or equal.

        ^U^Bnumber^b^u ^B-lt^b ^U^Bnumber^b^u  Numbers compare less than.

        The above basic expressions, in which unary operators have
        precedence over binary operators, may be combined with the
        following operators (listed in increasing order of precedence):

              expr -o expr            Logical OR.
              expr -a expr            Logical AND.
              ! expr                  Logical NOT.
              ( expr )                Grouping.

        On operating systems not supporting ^U^B/dev/fd/n^b^u devices (where ^U^Bn^b^u is
        a file descriptor number), the ^Btest^b command will attempt to fake
        it for all tests that operate on files (except the ^B-e^b test).  For
        example, [ -w /dev/fd/2 ] tests if file descriptor 2 is writable.

        Note that some special rules are applied (courtesy of POSIX) if
        the number of arguments to ^Btest^b or ^B[^b ^B...^b ^B]^b is less than five: if
        leading ‘!’ arguments can be stripped such that only one argument
        remains then a string length test is performed (again, even if
        the argument is a unary operator); if leading ‘!’ arguments can
        be stripped such that three arguments remain and the second
        argument is a binary operator, then the binary operation is
        performed (even if the first argument is a unary operator,
        including an unstripped ‘!’).

        ^BNote^b: A common mistake is to use “if [ $foo = bar ]” which fails
        if parameter “foo” is NULL or unset, if it has embedded spaces
        (i.e. IFS characters), or if it is a unary operator like ‘!’ or
        ‘^B-n^b’.  Use tests like “if [ "X$foo" = Xbar ]” instead.
