Standard ^Verrnames^v and ^Verrno^v values according to ^B/usr/include/sysexits.h^b.

^Verrname^v^/^Verrno^v is one of
    ^TOK^t^/^V0^v
    ^TUSAGE^t^/^V64^v The command was used incorrectly, eg: with the wrong number of 
        arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
    ^TDATAERR^t^/^V65^v The input data was incorrect in some way. This should only be 
        used for user’s data, not system files.
    ^TNOINPUT^t^/^V66^v An input file, not a system file, did not exist or was not 
        readable.  This could also include errors like “^INo message^i” to a 
        mailer (if it cared to catch it).
    ^TNOUSER^t^/^V67^v The user specified did not exist.  This might be used for mail 
        addresses or remote logins.
    ^TNOHOST^t^/^V68^v The host specified did not exist.  This is used in mail 
        addresses or network requests.
    ^TUNAVAILABLE^t^/^V69^v A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a support 
        program or file does not exist.  This can also be used as a catchall 
        message when something you wanted to do doesn’t work, but you don’t 
        know why.
    ^TSOFTWARE^t^/^V70^v An internal software error has been detected. This should be 
        limited to non-operating system related errors as possible.
    ^TOSERR^t^/^V71^v An operating system error has been detected. This is intended to 
        be used for such things as “^Icannot fork^i”, “^Icannot create pipe^i”, or the 
        like.  It includes things like ^Tgetuid^t returning a user that does not 
        exist in the ^Tpasswd^t file.
    ^TOSFILE^t^/^V72^v Some system file (eg: ^T/etc/passwd^t, ^T/var/run/utmp^t, etc.) does 
        not exist, cannot be opened, or has an error (eg: ^Bsyntax error^b).
    ^TCANTCREAT^t^/^V73^v A user specified output file cannot be created.
    ^TIOERR^t^/^V74^v An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
    ^TTEMPFAIL^t^/^V75^v temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an 
        error.  In sendmail, this means that a mailer, for example,  could not 
        create a connection, and the request should be reattempted later.
    ^TPROTOCOL^t^/^V76^v the remote system returned something that was “^Inot possible^i” 
        during a protocol exchange.
    ^TNOPERM^t^/^V77^v You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation. 
        This is not intended for file system problems, which should use 
        ^BNOINPUT^b or ^BCANTCREAT^b, but rather for higher level permissions.
    ^TCONFIG^t^/^V78^v Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.
