^Btrap^b [^U^Bhandler^b^u ^U^Bsignal^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        Sets a trap handler that is to be executed when any of the
        specified signals are received.  ^U^Bhandler^b^u is either a NULL string,
        indicating the signals are to be ignored, a minus sign (‘-’),
        indicating that the default action is to be taken for the signals
        (see signal(3)), or a string containing shell commands to be
        evaluated and executed at the first opportunity (i.e. when the
        current command completes, or before printing the next PS1
        prompt) after receipt of one of the signals.  ^U^Bsignal^b^u is the name
        of a signal (e.g. PIPE or ALRM) or the number of the signal (see
        the ^Bkill^b ^B-l^b command above).

        There are two special signals: EXIT (also known as 0), which is
        executed when the shell is about to exit, and ERR, which is
        executed after an error occurs (an error is something that would
        cause the shell to exit if the ^B-e^b or ^Berrexit^b option were set -
        see the ^Bset^b command above).  EXIT handlers are executed in the
        environment of the last executed command.  Note that for non-
        interactive shells, the trap handler cannot be changed for
        signals that were ignored when the shell started.

        With no arguments, ^Btrap^b lists, as a series of ^Btrap^b commands, the
        current state of the traps that have been set since the shell
        started.  Note that the output of ^Btrap^b cannot be usefully piped
        to another process (an artifact of the fact that traps are
        cleared when subprocesses are created).

        The original Korn shell's DEBUG trap and the handling of ERR and
        EXIT traps in functions are not yet implemented.
