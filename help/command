^Bcommand^b [^B-pVv^b] ^U^Bcmd^b^u [^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        If neither the ^B-v^b nor ^B-V^b option is given, ^U^Bcmd^b^u is executed exactly
        as if ^Bcommand^b had not been specified, with two exceptions:
        firstly, ^U^Bcmd^b^u cannot be an alias or a shell function; and
        secondly, special built-in commands lose their specialness (i.e.
        redirection and utility errors do not cause the shell to exit,
        and command assignments are not permanent).

        If the ^B-p^b option is given, a default search path is used instead
        of the current value of PATH (the actual value of the default
        path is system dependent: on POSIX-ish systems, it is the value
        returned by ^Bgetconf^b ^BPATH^b).  Nevertheless, reserved words,
        aliases, shell functions, and builtin commands are still found
        before external commands.

        If the ^B-v^b option is given, instead of executing ^U^Bcmd^b^u, information
        about what would be executed is given (and the same is done for
        ^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u).  For special and regular built-in commands and
        functions, their names are simply printed; for aliases, a command
        that defines them is printed; and for commands found by searching
        the PATH parameter, the full path of the command is printed.  If
        no command is found (i.e. the path search fails), nothing is
        printed and ^Bcommand^b exits with a non-zero status.  The ^B-V^b option
        is like the ^B-v^b option, except it is more verbose.
