^Bpwd^b [^B-LP^b]
        Print the present working directory.  If the ^B-L^b option is used or
        if the ^Bphysical^b option isn't set (see the ^Bset^b command below), the
        logical path is printed (i.e. the path used to ^Bcd^b to the current
        directory).  If the ^B-P^b option (physical path) is used or if the
        ^Bphysical^b option is set, the path determined from the filesystem
        (by following ‘..’ directories to the root directory) is printed.
