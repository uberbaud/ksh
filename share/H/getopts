^Bgetopts^b ^U^Boptstring^b^u ^U^Bname^b^u [^U^Barg^b^u ^U^B...^b^u]
        Used by shell procedures to parse the specified arguments (or
        positional parameters, if no arguments are given) and to check
        for legal options.  ^U^Boptstring^b^u contains the option letters that
        ^Bgetopts^b is to recognize.  If a letter is followed by a colon, the
        option is expected to have an argument.  Options that do not take
        arguments may be grouped in a single argument.  If an option
        takes an argument and the option character is not the last
        character of the argument it is found in, the remainder of the
        argument is taken to be the option's argument; otherwise, the
        next argument is the option's argument.

        Each time ^Bgetopts^b is invoked, it places the next option in the
        shell parameter ^U^Bname^b^u and the index of the argument to be
        processed by the next call to ^Bgetopts^b in the shell parameter
        OPTIND.  If the option was introduced with a ‘+’, the option
        placed in ^U^Bname^b^u is prefixed with a ‘+’.  When an option requires
        an argument, ^Bgetopts^b places it in the shell parameter OPTARG.

        When an illegal option or a missing option argument is
        encountered, a question mark or a colon is placed in ^U^Bname^b^u
        (indicating an illegal option or missing argument, respectively)
        and OPTARG is set to the option character that caused the
        problem.  Furthermore, if ^U^Boptstring^b^u does not begin with a colon,
        a question mark is placed in ^U^Bname^b^u, OPTARG is unset, and an error
        message is printed to standard error.

        When the end of the options is encountered, ^Bgetopts^b exits with a
        non-zero exit status.  Options end at the first (non-option
        argument) argument that does not start with a ‘-’, or when a ‘--’
        argument is encountered.

        Option parsing can be reset by setting OPTIND to 1 (this is done
        automatically whenever the shell or a shell procedure is
        invoked).

        Warning: Changing the value of the shell parameter OPTIND to a
        value other than 1, or parsing different sets of arguments
        without resetting OPTIND, may lead to unexpected results.
